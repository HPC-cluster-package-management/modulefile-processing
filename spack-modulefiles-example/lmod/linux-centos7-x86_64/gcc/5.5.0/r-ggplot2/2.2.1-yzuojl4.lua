whatis([[Name : r-ggplot2]])
whatis([[Version : 2.2.1]])
whatis([[Short description : An implementation of the grammar of graphics in R. It combines the advantages of both base and lattice graphics: conditioning and shared axes are handled automatically, and you can still build up a plot step by step from multiple data sources. It also implements a sophisticated multidimensional conditioning system and a consistent interface to map data to aesthetic attributes. See http://ggplot2.org for more information, documentation and examples.]])
