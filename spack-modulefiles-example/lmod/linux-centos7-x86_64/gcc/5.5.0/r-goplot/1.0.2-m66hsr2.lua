whatis([[Short description : Implementation of multilayered visualizations for enhanced graphical representation of functional analysis data. It combines and integrates omics data derived from expression and functional annotation enrichment analyses. Its plotting functions have been developed with an hierarchical structure in mind: starting from a general overview to identify the most enriched categories (modified bar plot, bubble plot) to a more detailed one displaying different types of relevant information for the molecules in a given set of categories (circle plot, chord plot, cluster plot, Venn diagram, heatmap).]])
