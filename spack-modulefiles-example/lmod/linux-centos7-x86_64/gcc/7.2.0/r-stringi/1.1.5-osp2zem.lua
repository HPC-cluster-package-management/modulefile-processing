whatis([[Name : r-stringi]])
whatis([[Version : 1.1.5]])
whatis([[Short description : Allows for fast, correct, consistent, portable, as well as convenient character string/text processing in every locale and any native encoding. Owing to the use of the ICU library, the package provides R users with platform-independent functions known to Java, Perl, Python, PHP, and Ruby programmers. Among available features there are: pattern searching (e.g., with ICU Java-like regular expressions or the Unicode Collation Algorithm), random string generation, case mapping, string transliteration, concatenation, Unicode normalization, date-time formatting and parsing, etc.]])
